# hybrid-am
So to my Additive Manufacturing brethren / community, I’m building a hybrid 3D printer (FDM based, 1m x 1m x 1m build volume, high temperature, heated build chamber, etc.) of my own design where the intent is to also make it a CNC mill, and a laser cutter / engraver 30W/7.5W output, where I want to make the software pick which head to engage and use. My intent is to make it entirely open source and updateable over time. My board is a Bigtreetech SKR Pro V1.2 to start, with a BTT TFT 70 touchscreen module, and BL Touch auto Leveling sensor. I have a few different extruders /hot ends I’m picking from but the one I’ll most likely put on this is a 3 in 1 out that can both mix filaments or choose between the three different filaments so that I can run two different printing materials and support material at the same time. I would like to be able to print and have the CNC be able to come back and mill surfaces, and or use the laser to cut or smooth surfaces along the way as well. As my weakest skill is programming, would anyone be willing to collaborate with me to write code to help produce this system?  First, I would be forever grateful as I love expanding technical capabilities, but secondly this will provide an open source hybrid AM system for all to enjoy as well...and to improve upon over time. Once I’m done with this I will be sharing everything to the open source community for anyone else to build, improve upon, etc as well. Not trying to make money off of this. So far this system in it’s entirety will be under $1K to build. I appreciate any help or thoughts you all may have!
